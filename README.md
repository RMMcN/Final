Global Carbon Emmissions from 1970-2015
The Global Carbon Footprint (1970 - 2015)
This project is an interactive and dynamic visualization tool that displays global carbon emissions data from 1970 to 2015.

This repository contains the essential files and folders for a basic visualization tool built using Shiny on RStudio.

The three necessary Shiny app files are included as .R files:

- **Global.R**: Contains global variables and loads the required packages.
- **ui.R**: The user interface file, which outlines the application's layout, user input buttons/interactions, and pulls outputs.
- **server.R**: Processes user input from ui.R, analyzes data, and generates outputs (visualizations) that are sent to ui.R for display.

The repository also includes two folders:

- **data**: Contains the .csv data source.
- **www**: Contains images used in the app.
